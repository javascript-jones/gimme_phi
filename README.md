# Gimme Phi

Gimme Phi is a simple web application built with Create React App that allows you to calculate proportional values based on the Golden Ratio. You can access the deployed version of the app [here](https://www.gimmephi.com/), which is hosted on Netlify.

## How to Use the App

1. Visit [Gimme Phi](https://www.gimmephi.com/) in your web browser.
2. You will see two input boxes labeled "Left" and "Right."
3. To calculate the proportional value for a number, enter a value in either the "Left" or "Right" box.
4. If you enter a number in the "Left" box, the "Right" box will update with its smaller proportional value according to the Golden Ratio.
5. If you enter a number in the "Right" box, the "Left" box will update with its larger proportional value according to the Golden Ratio.

That's it! You can experiment with different numbers and observe their proportional values based on the Golden Ratio.
